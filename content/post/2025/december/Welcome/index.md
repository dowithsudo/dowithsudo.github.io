# Welcome

> **Building, Breaking, Learning, and Rock and Roll**

Welcome 👋

Thanks for stopping by. Seriously.

This website is my personal blog. Nothing fancy, no marketing buzzwords.

It started as a place to document my work in IT, but over time it became something more personal. A space where I write about what I actually experience, both inside and outside the IT world.

Yes, you’ll still find stories about servers going down, networks misbehaving, and systems that suddenly decide to test your patience. But you’ll also find everyday stories. Small moments, lessons learned, thoughts from daily life, and things that happen when work is done and the laptop is finally closed.

Because life is more than logs and alerts, even if those pay the bills.

I write about:

* Real-world IT troubleshooting, not lab-only scenarios
* System, server, and infrastructure notes
* Networking topics from daily work
* Technical reminders I don’t want to forget
* Personal stories and everyday experiences
* Lessons learned from work, life, and everything in between

Some posts are technical. Some are personal. Many are somewhere in the middle.

If it looks practical, it probably is. If it feels personal, it probably came from a real moment.

## About Me

My name is Danu.

I’m based in Bekasi, Indonesia, and I’ve been working in the IT world for more than 13 years. Mostly around systems, networks, infrastructure, and all the things that usually break outside office hours.

I don’t claim to know everything. I just trust logs more than assumptions, and I prefer solutions that stay stable at 3 AM.

This blog exists because:

* I think better when I write things down
* Documentation shouldn’t live only in ticket systems
* Real-world experience is often missing from tutorials
* Not every lesson comes from technology

Sometimes the most valuable takeaways come from small, non-technical moments.

And yes, coffee. Black coffee is basically part of the workflow.

## Why This Blog Exists

The main goal of this blog is simple.

I hope each article here can provide:

* Useful insights
* Practical, realistic solutions
* References you can actually apply

Not everything here will fit your environment. That’s normal. Different networks, different constraints, different risks. Use what makes sense, adjust the rest.

Security, stability, and maintainability matter more to me than shiny setups that look cool but fall apart under load.
