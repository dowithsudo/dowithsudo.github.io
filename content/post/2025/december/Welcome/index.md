# Welcome To My Blog.

Thanks for stopping by. I mean that.

This site is my personal blog. It stays simple on purpose. No marketing talk. No polished promises.

I started this blog to write down my work in IT. Over time, it turned into something more personal. It became a place to record real situations, both technical and human. Servers fail. Networks act strange. Systems choose the worst timing. Life keeps going after the laptop shuts down.

Logs and alerts pay the bills. Life still happens around them.

Here is what I write about:

- Real IT troubleshooting from production systems  
- Server and infrastructure notes from daily work  
- Network problems that appear outside diagrams  
- Technical reminders worth keeping  
- Personal stories from normal days  
- Lessons from work and life  

Some posts focus on technical detail. Some focus on experience. Many sit between both.

If it feels practical, it came from real work. If it feels personal, it came from a real moment.

## about me

My name is Danu.

I live in Bekasi, Indonesia. I have worked in IT for more than 14 years. My days revolve around systems, networks, infrastructure, and things that tend to break after office hours.

By the way, this blog exists for a few reasons:

- Writing helps me think clearly  
- Documentation should live outside ticket tools  
- Real experience rarely appears in tutorials  
- Not every lesson comes from technology  

Small moments often teach more than major incidents.

Black coffee stays close. It counts as part of the workflow.

## why this blog exists

The goal stays simple.

Each article aims to offer:

- Useful context  
- Practical ideas  
- References you can apply  

Not every setup matches your environment. That is normal. Networks differ. Constraints differ. Risks differ. Take what fits and adjust the rest.

Stability matters more than shiny setups that fail under load. Security stays a process, not a checklist.
